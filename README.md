therefore rendering easy access and support to their dietary plan.

### SUCCESS STORIES
The success stories feature real-persons struggles, motivations, hacks and tips to support and encourage users thinking of making healthy lifestyle changes but get held back by a reason or more.   

#### SHARE YOUR JOURNEY:
It is a signup form that gives you the opportunity to share your health & fitness tips, hacks and journey with others, because together we can make a difference.   

## Features Left to Implement
##### Future release ideas: 
1. Implementation of video for both workout programs and recipes.      
2. Individual account signups instead of signup forms: a platform where users can open an account and share their health & fitness contents.  
3. Comments and interactions on shared contents.
