                              after which she vowed to herself to make better lifestyle changes get her body stronger and healthier as a precaution  for her own pregnancy and child birth journey.
                              To quote her “my goal is to do my best and my part in preparing my body for child birth and being  healthy enough to train my children, even though some people will argue that there is nothing you can do about pregnancy complications (pre - eclampsia) , but I believe that if my body is stronger, 
                              I can go through pregnancy seamlessly.”</p>

                             <p><strong>Fitness tip:</strong>“Just do it. Start walking, and don't look at anyone or anything, focus on your daily achievements. Stay away from the scale! Celebrate your ability to take 1000 steps, your ability to finish 4litres of water daily, your ability to dress up and show up and do the work required. The exercise that didn't work is the exercise you didn't do. 
                              PS: you don't have to join a gym immediately, start with your stairs, your backyard, your couch and a skipping rope. Just start.”</p>
                             <p><strong>Motivation:</strong>“The gains are my motivations: the uplifting moods, the energy burst, the body curves n tones, the strength I have developed, the clear mind, the better immune system etc I can keep going because once you get into the fitness journey the possibilities are endless and every gratifying!”</p>

Aziza was body shamed by people which made her feel insecure in her own body, instead of letting does negative feelings and emotions takeover her beauty and self-worth, she made a choice to join the gym and started making healthier choices. Aziza started with little to no experience in fitness and soon learned her way up, with each milestone she felt better and got stronger. Her initial goal was to join the gym and lose the weight but after she lost the weight, 
                                 she realized fitness is far beyond what is on the outside to quote her “ For me fitness is therapeutic, I learned the misconceptions regarding working out, so I decided to continue making healthier lifestyle choices”.</p>
